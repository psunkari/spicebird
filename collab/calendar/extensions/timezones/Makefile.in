# HOWTO update the timezones.sqlite:
#
# 1. Download latest vzic and Olson database
#    <http://www.twinsun.com/tz/tz-link.htm>
#    resp. <ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/>
#
#    Modify vzic Makefile to your OLSON_DIR and set *empty* TZID_PREFIX, then
#    then make vzic and execute to produce zoneinfo.
#
# 2. Then, make update=<vzic-dir>/zoneinfo/zones.tab
#
#    a)  This will read both the current (old) timezones.sqlite from
#        mozilla/calendar/timezones/timezones.sqlite and produce a new timezones.sqlite
#    b)  This will read the current timezones.properties and dump out which identifiers
#        are obsolete and which ones are to be added.
